# 2048Snake

HI,
_2048Snake_ is a  handy puzzle game made by Cocos2d-x. Like the classic game,_Snake_, it requires players to control the snake's direction through swiping the screen consciously.Through combining the head with the number, the value of the head will change it's value or extend its body. When the value of head equals to 2048, Bingo, you'll get it!
  
  Hope u guys enjoy it :D
